# SocialNetworkAPI
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.
Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data


## Description
The Social Network API is a tool to build a back-end for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The API uses the Express.js and Mongoose packages, and the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies

```npm install```

3. Run the server

```npm start```

4. Use Insomnia Core to test the API routes

## Usage
The Social Network API allows users to create, update, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions. Users can also add and remove friends from their friend list.
